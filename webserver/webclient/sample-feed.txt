BlenderBottle Classic V2 Shaker Bottle

Who It's For
Perfect for anyone who prefers a basic, no-frills shaker bottle that is durable and offers a secure grip.

Why We Love It
If you're looking for a no-frills bottle that will provide a smooth and satisfying pre- or post-workout shake, the BlenderBottle Radian Shaker Bottle is for you. We like the design of this bottle, especially the durable aluminum finish, secure grip, and wide mouth spout that allows for easy sipping. 

The wire blending ball is standard but gets the job done. After 30 seconds of shaking, the liquid and protein powder were well-mixed. Simplicity was apparent across the board with this product, as a soap and water solution cleared out any residue with ease. We appreciate that the bottle is effortless to cleanâ€”an important feature in any shaker bottle.
